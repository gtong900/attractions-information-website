# Hello, everyone: this repository is used for storing and displaying some of my work in the past.
# About Trath: This is a .NET dynamic data_driven website developed on visual studio which I spent two weeks making in undergraduate year 2. Pretty many functions and details are designed and practiced in this project. I was content and happy to have opportunity to take this project independently although it looks immature at the moment. "Trath" is combination of travel and truth as by this website I want to give user some true help and experience when they surf among information of those tourist attractions around the world.
