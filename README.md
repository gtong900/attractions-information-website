# About Trath: 
# This is a .NET dynamic data_driven website developed on visual studio which I spent two weeks making in undergraduate year 2. Pretty many functions and details are designed and practiced in this project. I was content and happy to have opportunity to take this project independently although it looks immature at the moment.
# This website used to work locally and I recently configured it and managed to put it onto the public network with help of Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform.
# "Trath" is combination of travel and truth as by this website I want to give user some true help and experience when they surf among information of those tourist attractions around the world.
